### Scaling Questions

* They care less about features and a lot more about ability to understand scale and web services 
	* What kind of things might not function right
	* Is it ready for production?

### Coding Questions

* On your own machine you should jump in quickly
* Often you're given something very vague. That vagueness is intentional. Be very sure and ask plenty of questions about what you're expected to build: a method, class, etc. 
	* Be really really clear on what it is you want to create before you start coding.
