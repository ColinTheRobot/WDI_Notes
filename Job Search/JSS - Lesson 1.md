### Your Elevator Pitch/Introduction

* What's an elevator pitch?
	* A very short pitch
	* 20 seconds or less
* Why's it important?
	* Forces you to focus on the critical things that are important to the person you're talking to
	* Exercise in figuring out - what people are looking for in your, quick pitch to make you sound interesting to them in 20-30 seconds
	* If you just met somebody, you don't have a ton of time to get and keep their interest. 
* Purpose of an elevator pitch
	* Helps you get a meeting
		* Use at networking opportunities, job fairs, speed interviews
		* Sells the idea of having a meeting with you
		* Foundation for written communication
	* *Note: The elevator pitch is a hook, it won't get you a job or a check*

### Networking

**How & Where?**

* Best way to find a job
	* We want to work with those we know and like
	* Job ads draw too many applicants
	* Many jobs are filled before advertising
* Challenges
	* Might seem too pushy, selfish
	* Fear of rejection
	* Intimidating 
	
**Getting Started**

* Understand your networking landscape
	* List companies that you would like to work at
	* List who's already on your network - friends and acquaintances
	* Lookup your 2nd degree connections
* Be visibile
	* Attend Meetups, Google+ circles fro Rails engineers (for newbies and general ones, Hacker hours)
	* Diversify, socialize in other circles
	* Stay in touch
	
**Building Strong Relationships**

* Like any relationship, network is built on trust
* 3 keys to building trust:
	1. visibility: they know who you are and what you do
	2. Credibility: They know that you're good at it
	3. Pofitability: They can trust you enough to do business with you
* How to build this trust? Sit down and get to know the person
* Connect on another level - find common interests

**Become the Go-To Person**

* Do not ask for favor when you first meet someone
* Never start a meeting asking for a favor - even when you know them
* Research and learn how you might be able to help them
* Proactively offer to assist
	* Job referral (if they're looking), introductions, being a reference, inviting to hackathon, happy hours
	
**How to Ask for a Favor**

* Do not reach out to them only when you need something
* Arrange an informal meeting (coffee etc.) via email
* Email must be short and sweet - could be a simple "catch up"
* Listen when you meet
* Offer to help them if topic arises
* Ways to ask:
	* Advice on what they look for
	* Could they be a refernece?
	* Or simply close the discussion with "let me know if you hear..."
	
**Maintaining the Network**

* Use every free minute to connect
	* Email, call, get coffee/ lunch/ rock climbing (or any other common interest!) appointment
	* Remember birthdays
	* Get updates - promotions, new jobs, blogs,...
* Never too late to get back in touch

**Hackathons**

* Great way to meet other web developers and get more experience
* hackerleague.org
* Eventbrite & Flavorpill - search Hackathons in NYC

**Meet Ups**

* Dozens of developers and tech meet ups in NYC
	* Examples: FEWD & BEWD GA Study Groups, Extra Credit General Assembly, NY Tech Meetup, NYC.RB
