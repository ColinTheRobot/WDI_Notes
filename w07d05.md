# Day 35 Notes | Week 7 Day 5

April 11, 2014

---

### Learning Objectives

* Understand and Explain Acceptance tests
* Think critically about the requirements of a user story
* User Capybara to write acceptance tests

### Testing

* Testing we've done
	* **Unit Tests** (Models/Method-level)
		* Types
			* RSpec
			* MiniTest
		* Helps devs implement low-level functionality
			* Necessary to make high-level tests pass
	* Functional (for Ruby: Controllers)
	* **Acceptance** (features)
		* Built around user stories 
		* Drive web interface by clicking links, fill in forms, etc
			* Automated forms of the testing we're already doing
		* For these to run, we're exercising our controllers
			* So in essence our controllers are being tested
		* Types of acceptance tests 
			1. Proof to client that app does what it should
			2. Guides devs at high level
		* Work only on one acceptance test at a time
			* Prevents feature creep
	* Integration
* Acceptance Tests
	* Feature.specs
		* Test a swath of testing functionality in our test
		
* Types of Tests

### Capybara
	
* Another testing framework that can integrate with either RSpec or MiniTest.
	* We will be using Capybara + RSpece
* Drivers
	* Capybara accepts drivers, which is what drives a web page
		* Selenium 
			* Based off Firefox and is one way Capybara can interact with webpages
		* RackTest
			* Headless, means there's no GUI (all happens behind the scenes)
* DOM (Document Object Model)
	* Browser's internal programmatic representation of the document's HTML
	* Analogy
		* Equivalent to JSON parsed into Ruby and turned into a hash. A hash is a programmatic object that we can manipulate (call methods on)
