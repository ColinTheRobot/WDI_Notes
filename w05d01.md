### Agile Development

* More error checking built-in
	* testing project throughout the process
* Break project into smaller features
	* Have a large group of people working on separate stories communicating all the way through
* Waterfall Development
	* Cons:
		* Harder to find errors
* Tools
	* RSpec/Testing
	* ERDs
		* Figure out models you want to have, their attributes, and how they relate to each other before you even begin coding
		* Helps us plan out out thoughts and how the entities of our app will work together
	* REPL (Pry)
		* Allows us to debug our app while we're building it and not once everything is starting to fail
	* user stories
* Problems
	* Syntax
	* Architecture related to UX/UI
	* blank page problem
	* order, how to build it

### User Stories

* First Step of Agile Development
	 * Always have a plan. Never start coding without having a plan first.
	 	* User stories help us solve a lot of these problems.
* Feature
	* Particular functionality of application
	* What types of users?
		* Power Users
		* Small-time user
		* Admin
	* Make a user story for each *type of user* you may have on your site
* Structure of a User Story
	* As a (blank), I want to (blank) so that (blank).
		* A *who* a *what* and a *why*. Who are they, what do they want to do and why do they want to do it?
	* Power User Example
		* As a power user I want to make a catalogue of all the movies in the world so I can always have info about movies. 
	* If you ever find yourself with a feature with no user benefit, you may not need that feature.
